## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Token Efficiency Strategies

#### LLMLingua Integration
```markdown
**Budget Controller Implementation:**
1. Allocate token budget by section importance:
   - Core reasoning: 40-50%
   - Context & implications: 25-30%
   - Direct answer: 15-20%
   - Sources: 5-10%

2. Token-Level Compression Targets:
   - Remove redundant qualifiers and filler words
   - Compress repetitive explanations
   - Optimize conjunction usage
   - Streamline citation formats
```

#### Progressive Disclosure Optimization
```markdown
**Layer-Based Information Architecture:**
Layer 1: Essential core (1-2 sentences)
Layer 2: Key implementation details (1-2 paragraphs)
Layer 3: Technical depth (expandable)
Layer 4: References and further reading

**Implementation:**
- Use collapsible sections for technical depth
- Provide summary bullets for quick scanning
- Offer "show more detail" options for interested users
```

### Quality Enhancement Frameworks

#### Confidence Calibration System
```markdown
**Confidence Level Implementation:**
- Very High (0.9-1.0): Multiple T1-T2 source verification
- High (0.75-0.89): Strong T2-T3 evidence with cross-validation
- Moderate (0.5-0.74): Reasonable evidence with acknowledged limitations
- Low (0.25-0.49): Limited evidence, clearly flagged uncertainty

**Implementation Protocol:**
1. Assess evidence strength during verification phase
2. Cross-reference multiple sources for important claims
3. Explicitly flag areas of uncertainty or assumption
4. Link confidence to specific evidence tiers
```

#### Multi-Dimensional Verification
```markdown
**Verification Checkpoint Implementation:**
**Verification: Confidence** F[✓:X/Y] C[✓:X/Y] T1[%] T2[%] T3+[%] Conf:[0.XX]
**Verification: Sources** Src:[# total] Conv:[consensus level] Div:[source diversity]
**Verification: Tool Output** Structure[✓:X/Y] Semantic[✓:X/Y]

**Practical Application:**
- Validate fact accuracy with autonomous tools
- Cross-check calculations using get_calculation_result
- Verify current information with search tools
- Assess logical consistency in reasoning chains
```

- Synthesis phase: 10-15% of total thoughts

**Branch Management:**
- Create branches for competing hypotheses
- Use revision markers for iterative improvement
